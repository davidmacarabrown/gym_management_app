# Gym Management Suite

## Project Brief
A local gym has asked you to build a piece of software to help them manage memberships and register members for classes.

## MVP
- The app should allow the gym to create and edit members
- The app should allow the gym to create and edit classes 
- The app should allow the gym to book members into specific classes
- The app should be able to display a list of all upcoming classes, and show the members booked for each

### Future Developement
If development was to continue the following features would be added
- A maximum capacity could be added to each class, and members only could be booked into them if there is space available
- Add additional depth to membership with varying levels, such as premium and standard. Premium members could be given privileges such as booking priority, and Standard members could be limited to booking classes only in off-peak hours.
